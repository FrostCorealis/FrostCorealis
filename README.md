## Hi!  I'm Frost. ‚ú® 

###Welcome to my GitHub!  Through words and code, this space documents my journey as a developer.  üó∫Ô∏è

If you're new to Web3, keep grinding.  Leveling up can be challenging but it's always rewarding, and Web3 is an incredible space to explore, dream, learn, and grow. üåø

Not too long ago, the most creative thing I was building was google slide decks.  Admittedly, some of them were pretty amazing, but they were still just slide decks.  I missed building websites, and I felt really stuck so...I took a risk and made a BIG change.

In June of 2021, I started working in Codecademy to dust off my HTML & CSS skills, update my knowledge of JavaScript, and learn Python.  In July, I went to the Chainlink Bootcamp, and after that, I decided to sign up for the Chainlink Fall Hackathon.  In preparation for the hackathon, I read Solidity docs, and Chainlink docs, and spent a lot of time with CryptoZombies. üßü

Finding Buildspace was a game-changer.  Suddenly I had real projects to debug + lots of other devs to chat with in Discord + practical applications for the code I'd been learning.  Buildspace is a structured sandbox in which to tinker, and an amazing community full of devs who are learning together and helping and inspiring each other.  It's an exciting place to be. 

Rolling into 2022, I have some loose goals.  There are projects here that need to be cleaned up and expanded, and I recently started learning React.  There are new things on CryptoZombies + experiments I want to try with what I've learned there, and a couple of upcoming Buildspace workshops.  I've accomplished a lot in 6 months.  The next 6 months will be about tinkering, hacking, imagining, polishing, and exploring.
