### Hi!  I'm Frost. ‚ú® 

Welcome to my GitHub!  Through words and code, this space documents my journey as a developer.  üó∫Ô∏è

A year ago, the most creative thing I was doing with my computer was building google slide decks.  Admittedly, some of them were pretty amazing, but they were still just slide decks.

Now, I'm building smart contracts and the websites that let users interact with them.  I'm not quite ready for the bigtime, but I've accomplished a lot in just 5 months.

Back in June, I started working in Codecademy to dust off my HTML & CSS skills, update my knowledge of JavaScript, and learn Python.  In July, I went to the Chainlink Bootcamp, and decided to sign up for the Chainlink Hackathon.  At the time, I knew I had a lot of Solidity to learn before the Hackathon, but what I didn't know was how very much I didn't know. üôÇ

My teammate, Storm, is a game designer, a tokenomics analyst / designer, and an expert blockchain navigator.  He dreamed up RainCatcher and is creating the art for it.  I'm learning the skills to make RainCatcher work.

In preparation for the Hackathon, I spent a lot of time reading Solidity and Chainlink docs, and when Patrick Collins' YouTube video came out, I watched it and coded along.  More than once.

I struggled with Visual Studio Code.  I fought with Hardhat, Brownie, and assorted other installs, but with help from Storm, who is more experienced with the terminal than I, Visual Studio Code has been tamed.  For the most part.

The hackathon has been inspiring, frustrating, humbling, and life-changing.  CryptoZombies and Buildspace joined Storm as tangential members of Team Corealis.
