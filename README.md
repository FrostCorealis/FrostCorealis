### Hi!  I'm Frost. ‚ú® 

Welcome to my GitHub!  Through words and code, this space documents my journey as a developer.  üó∫Ô∏è

Not too long ago, the most creative thing I was doing was building google slide decks.  Admittedly, some of them were pretty amazing, but they were still just slide decks.

Now I'm building smart contracts and the websites that let users interact with them.  I'm not quite ready for the bigtime, but I've accomplished a lot in just 5 months.

In June of 2020, I started working in Codecademy to dust off my HTML & CSS skills, update my knowledge of JavaScript, and learn Python.  In July, I went to the Chainlink Bootcamp, and decided to sign up for the Chainlink Hackathon.  At the time, I knew I had a lot of Solidity to learn before the Hackathon, but what I didn't know was how very much I didn't know. üôÇ

Finding Buildspace changed everything for me!!  Buildspace provids practical applications for all my reading and Codecademy practicing.  Buildspace is a beautifully structured sandbox in which to tinker, and an amazing community full of devs who are learning together and helping and inspiring each other.  It's a wonderful place to be. 

If you're new to Web3, keep grinding.  Leveling up can be challenging but it's always rewarding, and Web3 is an incredible space to explore, dream, learn, and grow. üíö
