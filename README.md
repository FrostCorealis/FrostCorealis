### Hi!  I'm Frost. ✨ 

Welcome to my GitHub!  Through words and code, this space documents my journey as a developer.  🗺️

A year ago, the most creative thing I was doing with my computer was building google slide decks.  Admittedly, some of them were pretty amazing, but they were still just slide decks.

Now, I'm building smart contracts and websites to let users interact with them.  I'm not quite ready for the bigtime, but I've accomplished a lot in just 5 months.

Back in June, I started working in Codecademy to dust off my HTML & CSS skills, update my knowledge of JavaScript, and learn Python.  In July, I went to the Chainlink Bootcamp, and decided to sign up for the Chainlink Hackathon.  At the time, I knew I had a lot of Solidity to learn before the Hackathon, but what I didn't know was how very much I didn't know. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
